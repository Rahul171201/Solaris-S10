# Solaris-S10
Website project on a virtual phone features using Bootstrap, HTML and CSS

## Aim of this project
This project is one of my first projects on a complete website. The project focuses on providing a platform for a virtual mobile system model having great features of powered phones. The Solaris-S10 can be installed on Android and IOS devices . This is not a real world object or corporation, but is a real world based concept featured on my website.
    The project can be used to have a template for any large scale website
